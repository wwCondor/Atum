 Performance Testing:
    1. Memory Graph Debugger:
        - No runtime issues identified
    2. Memory Management:
        - Enabled Malloc Stack for Live Allocations showed no issues
    3. Image Loading Time:
        - The loading time for the images took considerable time. In fact to long to make a good user experience.
            Fix 1: The API call retrieving the BlueMarblePhotos has been switched from .png to a .jpg query.
            Fix 2: The images retrieved from various endpoints are reduced to a smaller size before loaded into the UIImageViews.
